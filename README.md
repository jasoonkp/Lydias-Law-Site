# Lydias-Law-Site

## 🧭 Project Overview

Lydia’s Law Site is a full-stack web application built for adoption attorney Lydia A. Suprun to modernize her practice and make her services more accessible to clients. Designed and developed by Shell Script, a senior project team from California State University, Sacramento, the site enables clients to schedule appointments, make secure payments, and learn more about Lydia’s work.

The project bridges real-world business needs with modern web development practices using Django, MySQL, and Bootstrap to deliver a reliable, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Built with future maintainability in mind, the platform allows Lydia to easily manage her content and continue growing her practice well beyond the completion of this project.
