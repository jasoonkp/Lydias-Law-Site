''' IMPORTANT FOR ALL WHO READ '''
# There seems to be a potential conflicts with different views that have been made for the same pages.
# For example there was a contact view in the sitecontent app but also one here in the core app.
# We should take time to separate views and organize/clean them up at some point.
